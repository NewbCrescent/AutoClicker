# AutoClicker

***How it Works:*** You press the start hotkey to start the auto clicker and the end hotkey to end it.

***Requirements:*** Need to have the keyboard and pynput libraries installed.
```
pip install pynput
```
```
pip install keyboard
```

***Customization:*** change the hotkeys and the delay to your liking. The default to start is "g" and to end is "f", with the delay almost being none.
